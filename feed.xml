I took
a different route this year and didn’t cover every Objective, but instead
went in-depth on reverse-engineering the infrastructure behind one of the
Objectives. I wanted to see how much of a remote environment was discoverable
when all an attacker has is the ability to read local files, no command or
code execution. In this instance, I was able to re-create the environment
enough to replicate it in a local Docker container. It was an interesting
challenge, and one I’m sure I’ll be able to use in the future in other
engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;, all necessary config files and scripts, and the exploit
script I used are on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeammond/HHC-2021-docker-config&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writeup" /><summary type="html">My writeup for ‘Objective 10’ is published.
