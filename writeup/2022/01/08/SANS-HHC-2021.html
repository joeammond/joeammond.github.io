I took a different route this year and didn’t cover every Objective, but instead went in-depth on reverse-engineering the infrastructure behind one of the Objectives.

In this instance, I was able to re-create the environment enough to replicate it in a local Docker container. It was an interesting challenge, and one I’m sure I’ll be able to use in the future in other engagements." />

    <p>My writeup for ‘Objective 10’ is <a href="https://ammond.org/writeups/SANS/HHC-2021">published</a>. I took
a different route this year and didn’t cover every Objective, but instead
went in-depth on reverse-engineering the infrastructure behind one of the
Objectives. I wanted to see how much of a remote environment was discoverable
when all an attacker has is the ability to read local files, no command or
code execution. In this instance, I was able to re-create the environment
enough to replicate it in a local Docker container. It was an interesting
challenge, and one I’m sure I’ll be able to use in the future in other
